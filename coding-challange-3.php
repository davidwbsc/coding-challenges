// Weekly coding challenge
//Take an array of numbers and find the highest sum of any continuous subarray of the array.  e.g. The array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86] would have a maximum of 137 taking the elements 42, 14, -5 and 86.  With the array [-5, -1, -8, -9] the maximum sum would be 0 because we would choose not to take any elements.
